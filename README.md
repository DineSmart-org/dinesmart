## Work Logs
### 01/30/26
Our team started the project by identifying a real-world problem and brainstorming solutions. We defined key features, selected the technology stack, and mapped out site navigation. We created 16 low-fidelity prototypes to explore the user experience, set up our GitHub repository, and chose our project name, icon, and logo.

### 01/31/26
Infrastructure setup day. We took the wireframes from yesterday and turned them into high-fidelity prototypes. Still doing a lot of research on what tech to use. Created 16 new low-fidelity prototypes for account and about pages.

### 02/01/26
Began implementation of location and about page. Researched options on map api integration. Began to hook up routing between pages.

------------------------------------------------------
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
